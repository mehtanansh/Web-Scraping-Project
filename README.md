This project was has 2 sections:

1) Web Scraper that helps in scraping a list of TVs and Mobiles on Amazon
This part is included in the folder: Amazon Web Scraper for TVs and Mobiles. One may use the code for data scraping and collection purpose
This part of the project is implemented using Python and it's libraries (Pandas, Beautiful Soup, Numpy, etc.). I have scraped data from Amazon India and created a Dataset of mobiles (.csv). 

2) Exploratory Data Analysis performed on the data scraped from Amazon Scraper
This part of the project is implemented using Python and it's libraries (Pandas, Beautiful Soup, Numpy, etc.). I have scraped data from Amazon India and created a Dataset of mobiles (.csv). Further, I have also performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the same

This project is just a basic project to showcase the concepts I learnt through Youtube and Online resources on Web Scraping and diplay my analytical skills.

# Features:

* Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup

  * I scraped the Amazon India Website and implemented a program for gathering information related to all the mobiles present on the site.

* Creating a Database of the different mobiles that are sold in the Indian market

  * The scraped data was stored as a csv file and was further used as a database.

* Data Preprocessing and EDA on the created dataset.

  * I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and provided my conclusions from the visualisations.

* Also mentioned some key problems in the dataset and some solutions to them.

  * I have mentioned and demonstrated some problems with the dataset and compared them to real life, since the data was formed from Amazon India's website. I have also justified the problems with examples and mentioned some solutions.

# The project was implemented using:
