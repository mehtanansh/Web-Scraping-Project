# Web-Scraping-Project
This Project is implemented using Python and it's libraries (Pandas, Beautiful Soup, Numpy,etc.). I have scraped data from Amazon India and created a Dataset of mobiles (.csv). Further, I have also performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the same

This project is just a basic project to showcase the concepts I learnt through Youtube and Online resources on Web Scraping and diplay my analytical skills.

# Features:

* Web Scraping using Beautiful Soup

  * I scraped the Amazon India Website and implemented a program for gathering information related to all the mobiles present on the site.

* Creating a Database of the different mobiles that are sold in the Indian market

  * The scraped data was stored as a csv file and was further used as a database.

* Data Preprocessing and EDA on the created dataset.

  * I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset and provided my conclusions from the visualisations.

* Also mentioned some key problems in the dataset and some solutions to them.

  * I have mentioned and demonstrated some problems with the dataset and compared them to real life, since the data was formed from Amazon India's website. I have also justified the problems with examples and mentioned some solutions.
